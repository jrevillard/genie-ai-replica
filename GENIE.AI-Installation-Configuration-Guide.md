# **GENIE.AI Installation and Configuration Guide**

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the GENIE.AI framework. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up, configure, and deploy your own Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution. The success of any AI-driven knowledge system lies in the quality and structure of its data. Therefore, the first and most critical phase is to define, curate, and structure the data that will form the backbone of your system's knowledge. This cannot be over-emphasized. It is the most critical aspect. Our suggestion is that you establish an initial MVP with the framework by simply curating the data, defining the knowledge hierarchy, configuring your quickhelp buttons with prompts and then labeling and ingesting your curated data prior to modifying any code. This way, you will get used to how the framework operates, before you delve into deeper issues and extensions. This approach can also be used to deliver a rapid solution to a RAG problem, without any coding at all (just implementing a knowledge base design and the associated configuration). The application title and theme can also be modified by configuration in JSON without changing code. The suggested approach for this is to utilize something like ChatGOT, Gemini Pro or Grok etc. to build a new configuration for color theme and title etc. This can be done in minutes.

For a high-level understanding of the system architecture before beginning any work, please refer to the [**Architecture Overview**](https://osaips.atlassian.net/wiki/external/N2U5ZjkwM2FhOTgyNDZlZjk3MWRlODY5Mzk5OTBhNjE). This will give you an insight into most of the high level components and how they are assembled.

### **Step 1: Data Curation and Knowledge Hierarchy (Conceptual Design)**

Before any data is ingested into GENIE.AI, you must first establish the scope of knowledge for your application and organize it logically. This process involves a strategic design of your knowledge core, the curation and verification of source documents, and the creation of an associated two-level labeling system that serves as the knowledge hierarchy within the framework's user interface (i.e., the Knowledge Hierarchy displayed on the left sidebar). Ingested data is tagged with these labels, and queries can also select the same labels, which enhances RAG accuracy as we have utilized labeling as part of the hybrid-retrieval strategy for RAG at the backend.

#### **1.1 Designing the Knowledge Core with Domain Analysis**

A powerful RAG solution is built on a well-designed data model. We recommend using a conceptual Venn diagram exercise with your subject matter experts to map your information landscape before you even start. This helps you visualize the relationships between different data sets and define the boundaries of your knowledge base. It helps you to identify the specific data sets you need and to ascertain the specific relationships between these data sets.

This process involves identifying three tiers of data:

* **Primary Data Sets (Core):** This is the essential information that directly addresses the most critical and frequent user queries. It forms the central circles of your diagram \- this totally depends on the scope of your solution. You can address as many facets of this central core set of data as required to serve the specific use case that you have in mind.  
* **Secondary Data Sets (Supporting):** This data provides necessary context and is often required to give a more complete answer. It is the second ring of your diagram circles and it overlaps significantly with the primary set. There could also be many bubbles in this secondary tier.  
* **Tertiary Data Sets (Peripheral):** This information is supplementary/peripheral and enhances the user's understanding, but may not be essential for every query. It has a minor overlap with the primary and secondary sets in specific areas. The Venn diagram is your best allie to get this right up front.

**Example Domain Analysis using Venn Diagrams:**

**1\. Agriculture**

* **Primary:** "Corn Crop Management Guide." This is the core document farmers need.  
* **Secondary:** "Approved Pesticides & Herbicides," "Chemical Fertilizer Specifications," "Soil Sample Analysis Protocols." These are directly referenced by the crop guide.  
* **Tertiary:** "Regional Weather Data," "Historical Market Prices," "Local Agricultural Equipment Suppliers." This data provides valuable context for decision-making.

**2\. Government Services**

* **Primary:** "Official Passport Application Process & Forms."  
* **Secondary:** "Schedule of Fees & Payment Options," "Civil Registry Database (for birth certificate verification)."  
* **Tertiary:** "List of Authorized Photo Studios," "Post Office Locations & Operating Hours."

**3\. Healthcare**

* **Primary:** "Clinical Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Management."  
* **Secondary:** "Pharmaceutical Database (Metformin, Insulin dosages)," "Nutritional & Dietary Plans for Diabetics."  
* **Tertiary:** "Directory of Endocrinologists," "Information on Local Support Groups," "Recommended Fitness Routines."

#### **1.2 Impact on the Labeling System Design**

This domain analysis directly informs the structure of your 2-level labeling system. The clear relationships and boundaries identified in the Venn diagrams translate naturally into a logical hierarchy. We suggest that you also use an AI-driven approach to assemble the labeling system design. You can use any of the common RAG tools like ChatGPT, Gemini or Grok for example to accomplish this in minutes. Once this is done, you will need to verify it with subject matter experts to ensure that it meets the needs of indexing the required data sets.

* **Categories (Level 1\)** often emerge from the overarching themes that group your primary and secondary data sets. For example, in Agriculture, the primary set "Corn Crop Management" and secondary sets like "Pesticides" and "Fertilizers" all fall under the logical **Category** of Crop Management.  
* **Services/Topics (Level 2\)** are the primary, secondary, and even tertiary data sets themselves. They become the specific, actionable knowledge points within a category.

**Tier-Based Design Strategy:** To translate your data tiers into a functional hierarchy, apply the following strategy:

1. **Primary Data MUST have dedicated labels:** Every primary data set represents a core user need and must have a distinct, clear Service (Level 2\) label.  
2. **Secondary Data usually needs dedicated labels:** These should generally have their own Service (Level 2\) labels, typically grouped under the same Category (Level 1\) as the primary data they support.  
3. **Group Tertiary Data to avoid clutter:** Avoid creating granular labels for every piece of tertiary data. Instead, group them into broader "Reference" or "General Information" Service labels. This prevents the hierarchy from becoming overwhelming while still making the data accessible.

**AVOID USING THE SAME LABELS FOR SERVICES IN MULTIPLE CATEGORIES**

**Common Sense Design Principles:**

* **User-Centric Naming:** Labels should reflect *user intent*, not internal organizational structures. A user looking for "Pesticides" does not care which government sub-department manages them.  
* **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE):** Aim for categories that don't overlap significantly. While documents can have multiple labels, the hierarchy itself should be clean and logical.  
* **Strict 2-Level Limit:** GENIE.AI uses a shallow hierarchy. Do not try to force a third level by creating overly complex names (e.g., avoid Crops \- Corn \- Pests \- Beetles; instead use Category: Crop Management, Service: Pest Control).

**Applying this to the Agriculture example:**

| Category (Level 1\) | Service/Topic (Level 2\) | Data Source Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Crop Management** | Corn Planting & Harvest Guide | Primary |
|  | Soil Health and Fertilization | Secondary |
|  | Pest and Disease Control | Secondary |
| **Market & Logistics** | Historical Market Prices | Tertiary (Grouped) |
|  | Approved Equipment Suppliers | Tertiary (Grouped) |

This method ensures your knowledge hierarchy is not arbitrary but is a direct reflection of how the information is interrelated, making the system more intuitive for both the AI and the end-user.

#### **1.3 Data Curation and Verification Process**

To deliver an accurate, trustworthy, and useful RAG solution, the underlying data must be meticulously curated and verified. Ingesting inaccurate, outdated, or poorly formatted data is the primary cause of poor performance and "hallucinations" in RAG systems. The GENIE.AI framework supports a wide range of file formats for the ingestion process.

**Supported Formats:**

* Web pages (.html, via URL links) \- note that depth of crawling for web sites can be controlled as well as the language accepted.  
* Documents (.pdf, .docx) \- .doc HAS been removed as it is legacy and problematic (conversion to .docx or .pdf is recommended)  
* Spreadsheets (.xlsx) \- .xls has been removed for the same problametic legacyt reasons. You can use .xlsx sparingly. We suggest this is done sparingly as there are limitations related to multiple tabs and some of the other salient aspects of spreadsheets (such as calculations and charts etc.) that are problematic.  
* Markdown (.md)  
* Plain Text (.txt)

**Supported Language for Ingestion**

* GENIE-AI is set up to support a single language for ingestion purposes.  
* The single language is configurable \- our default configuration is EN.  
* File uploads will be constrained to the single configured language (by language detection).  
* Language detection technology is not perfect (especially with URL links)... you can always convert the required information to a supported file type.  
* Translations are performed on the fly in and out of the backend by an LLM (also configurable).

**Curation Best Practices:**

1. **Source Vetting:** Always prioritize authoritative and official sources. For government services, this means official government websites and publications. For healthcare, use peer-reviewed medical journals, clinical guidelines from recognized health organizations, and regulatory bodies. **You will need a team of experts to validate and curate this knowledge and it will need to be agreed and signed-off before ingestion.**  
2. **Data Cleaning:** \* **Standardize Terminology:** Ensure consistent use of terms (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes" vs. "T2D").  
   * **Remove Duplicates & Noise:** Eliminate redundant documents, boilerplate text (headers, footers, irrelevant ads), and artifacts from the conversion process.  
   * **Verify OCR Accuracy:** When converting scanned PDFs, manually review the resulting text for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) errors, as these can introduce factual inaccuracies.  
3. **Logical Chunking:** Ensure that data is ingested and split into semantically meaningful chunks. A chunk should ideally represent a complete idea or paragraph. A split in the middle of a sentence can cause the system to lose context.

**Verification Workflow:**

1. **Subject Matter Expert (SME) Review:** This is the most critical step. Once data is curated, it must be reviewed by experts in the relevant domain. An agronomist should verify the crop data, and a doctor should verify the healthcare guidelines. SMEs check for factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance.  
2. **Version Control:** Your knowledge base is not static. Regulations, guidelines, and data change. Implement a system to track document versions and schedule regular reviews (e.g., annually) to update or retire outdated information. The sources for these documents should be version controlled. Note that documents can be retracted and ingested again as and when they change.  
3. **Establish a Feedback Loop:** The GENIE.AI framework includes capabilities for users to provide feedback on responses. This user feedback is an invaluable, continuous source of verification. A process must be in place to review flagged responses, trace them back to the source document, and make corrections as needed.

By following this rigorous process of designing, curating, and verifying your data, you will build a robust and reliable knowledge base that allows GENIE.AI to perform at its full potential.

### **Step 2: Prerequisites**

Before attempting installation, ensure your infrastructure meets the necessary requirements.

#### **2.1 Hardware Requirements**

GENIE.AI requires significant computational resources, particularly for AI model inference (LLMs, embeddings, rerankers). This is critical and the solution will potentially not even run without the required resources.

* Please refer to the [**T-Shirt Sizing Guide**](https://osaips.atlassian.net/wiki/external/ODg2YmZmZTJjNGMyNGQzYzgwZWUzNTk2NWI3NjdiMDk) to determine the appropriate hardware for your deployment scale. Even for development and MVP work, you will need to meet the minimum requirements outlined in the small tee shirt size.

#### **2.2 Software Prerequisites**

* **Ubuntu Linux 22.04:** Everything has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04. It is OK to use variant Linux distributions but that is something you need to resolve.  
* **Docker & Docker Compose:** Required for orchestrating the containerized services.  
* **NVIDIA Drivers & CUDA:** Required for GPU acceleration of the AI services (vLLM, TEI).  
  * Follow the [**NVIDIA Driver Installation Guide**](https://osaips.atlassian.net/wiki/external/NTY1ZGY1N2RmYzkzNGRiMGIxMzc1ZDM4ZjI4NmNlOTE) to ensure your host is ready for GPU workloads.  
* **Node.js:** Required for the JavaScript components

#### **2.3 Install and Verify Docker on Every Host**

Bash

##### 1\. Update and install prerequisites

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \-y ca-certificates curl gnupg

##### 2\. Add Docker's official GPG key

sudo install \-m 0755 \-d /etc/apt/keyrings

curl \-fsSL [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg) | sudo gpg \--dearmor \-o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

##### 3\. Set up the official Docker repository

echo  
"deb \[arch="$(dpkg \--print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\] [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu)  
"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION\_CODENAME")" stable" |  
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list \> /dev/null

##### 4\. Install Docker Engine

###### *(This also removes conflicting older versions like docker.io if present)*

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \-y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

##### 5\. Start and enable the Docker daemon

###### *(Necessary if the installer fails to start it automatically)*

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker

##### 6\. Grant your user standard Docker permissions

sudo usermod \-aG docker $USER

newgrp docker

##### 7\. Verify Docker

docker run hello-world

---

#### **2.4 Install Node.js on Every Host and Verify**

Bash

curl \-fsSL [https://deb.nodesource.com/setup\_lts.x](https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x) | sudo \-E bash \-

sudo apt-get install \-y nodejs

node \-v

npm \-v

---

### **Step 3: Base Installation**

You must complete one of these base docker compose based installations before configuring the application services (single node or three node) \- Kubernetes will be added later. The way that the 2 docker compose based deployent options are organized in the repository is as follows:

Plaintext

repository-root/  
├── docker-compose.yaml           \# Single-node docker compose deployment model  
├── env                           \# .env file for the single-node docker compose  
├── components/  
│   ├── docker-compose.yaml       \# Docker compose for infrastructure tier (three node model)  
│   ├── gov-chat-backend/  
│   │   └── env                   \# .env file for the node.js backend service  
│   ├── gov-chat-frontend/  
│   │   └── env                   \# .env file for the Vue 3 application  
│   └── document-repository/  
│       └── env                   \# .env file for the document repository service  
├── api-gateway-solution/  
│   ├── docker-compose.yaml       \# Docker compose for bastion host tier  
│   └── env                       \# .env file for the bastion tier  
└── opea/  
├── docker-compose.yaml       \# Docker compose for customized GENIE.AI OPEA  
└── env                       \# .env file for the OPEA tier

Following are the details for configuring both the single-node deployment model and the three node deployment model (Options A and B):

#### **Option A: Single-Node Installation (MVP/Dev)**

This method deploys all services onto a single host using Docker Compose.

1\. Clone the Repository

Clone the appropriate repository to your local machine:

* *Public Replica:* [https://gitlab.com/fordendk/genie-ai-replica](https://gitlab.com/fordendk/genie-ai-replica)  
* *Internal UNICC GitLab:* (Check with administrator)

Bash

git clone [https://gitlab.com/fordendk/genie-ai-replica](https://gitlab.com/fordendk/genie-ai-replica)  
cd genie-ai-replica

2\. Environment Configuration (.env)

The docker-compose.yaml file sources its configuration from an .env file located in the root of the repository (named env in the repo). You must create this file (e.g., by copying the existing env example to .env) and populate it with your specific settings.

The following tables document the key variables found in the .env file, grouped by the service they configure.

3\. Launch Services

Use the provided docker-compose.yaml to start the stack. This will spin up core services including Kong, Postgres, ArangoDB, Redis, Nginx, and the AI services (vLLM, TEI, etc.).

Note: that because we are using EasyOCR during the data prep process and it takes a while to download images in the container, the dockerfile is set up to unzip them. They must be downloaded into the root of the project folder in advance using wget.

Bash

wget \-O craft\_mlt\_25k.zip [https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/releases/download/pre-v1.1.6/craft\_mlt\_25k.zip](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/releases/download/pre-v1.1.6/craft_mlt_25k.zip)

wget \-O english\_g2.zip https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/releases/download/v1.3/english\_g2.zi

docker-compose up \--build \-d

⚠️ IMPORTANT: EXPECTED ERRORS

At this stage, while the containers are running, they are not yet configured. If you inspect the logs now, you will see many critical errors related to missing databases (ArangoDB), unconfigured routes (Kong), and unreachable upstreams (Nginx).

**This is normal. Do NOT attempt to debug these errors yet.**

Proceed immediately to **Step 4** to complete the necessary infrastructure configuration.

#### **Option B: Three-Node Installation (Production)**

**Option B** is a three node architecture. This style of architecture is recommended for production docker compose based deployments as it separates the concerns for each tier into separate nodes as follows:

1. **Bastion Node**: this host runs nginx as a reverse proxy, kong and the API gateway and keycloak for implementation of 3rd party identity services.  
2. **Infrastructure Node**: this host runs all the application infrastructure services (ArangoDB, node.js backend, Vue 3 frontend, redis-cache, document-repository and clamav).  
3. **AI/GPU Node**: this host runs the customized OPEA microservices backend.

Refer to the diagram above for the various docker-compose.yaml and associated .env files. Setting this up is simply a case of setting up the three hosts with the required operating system and dependencies and then configuring each of the components (the default configurations in the example env files should be mostly correct but will require adjustments for your host names and DNS etc.).

**Steps:**

1. Set up the virtual hosts as per the instructions with the required capacity  
2. Clone the repository to each node as per Option A.  
3. Set up your configurations as outlined in Option A above and adjust for the three node environment on each node.  
4. Bring up the environment

Bash

docker-compose up \--build \-d

5. Proceed as per Option A. then go to **Step 4: Infrastructure Configuration**

---

### **Step 4: Infrastructure Configuration**

Once the base services are running (Step 3), you must configure the core infrastructure components before the system is usable.

#### **4.1 ArangoDB Database Initialization**

While the arango-vector-db service is running, the specific application databases must be created.

1. Access the ArangoDB web interface at [http://localhost:8529](http://localhost:8529) (login with root and the password defined in your .env).  
2. Create the necessary databases as defined in your environment variables (default: genie-ai) \- ensure both the frontend and backend services use the same database.

#### **4.2 NGINX and Kong API Gateway Configuration**

There are Nginx default.conf files available for both three-node and single-node deployments:

1. For three-node deployments, use the default default.conf and modify the upstream addresses  
2. for single-node deployments, use the default.conf-single-node

Kong requires specific initialization and configuration to route traffic correctly.

1. **Initialize Database:** Execute these commands to prepare the Kong postgres database:

Bash

docker compose exec kong-database psql \-U kong postgres \-c "CREATE DATABASE kong;"

docker compose exec kong-database psql \-U kong postgres \-c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kong TO kong;"

docker compose run \--rm kong kong migrations bootstrap docker compose restart kong

2. **Apply Configuration:** Navigate to the config directory, stage the correct configuration file (overwriting the default kong\_config.json), and run the apply script (ensure that curl and jq are installed).  
   For Single-Node installation: 

Bash

cd api-gateway-solution/new-config/

cp kong\_config.json-single-node kong\_config.json

chmod \+x [manage-kong-config.sh](http://manage-kong-config.sh)

sudo apt update sudo apt install jq

./manage-kong-config.sh \-a

\*(For Three-Node installation, simply run ./manage-kong-config.sh \\-a as kong\\\_config.json is the default).\*

**Enter the correct hosts and expect the following output**:

Bash

govstack@bb-ai-gpu-01:\~/genie-ai-replica-single-node/api-gateway-solution/new-config$ ./manage-kong-config.sh \-a  
This script will configure your Kong instance.  
Please provide the required connection details.

#### **4.3 Nginx Configuration**

Nginx acts as the reverse proxy and SSL termination point.

1\. Navigate to api-gateway-solution/nginx.  
2\. Select the appropriate configuration file:  
\* For \*\*Single-Node\*\*, use: default.conf-single-node (rename to default.conf if necessary for volume mapping, or adjust mapping).  
\* For \*\*Three-Node\*\*, use: default.conf.  
3\. Ensure your SSL certificates are placed in the mapped volumes defined in docker-compose.yaml (nginx\\\_certs volume or ./api-gateway-solution/nginx/certs bind mount).

### Step 5: Knowledge Base Population & User Setup

With the infrastructure configured, you can now instantiate the knowledge hierarchy designed in Step 1 and create the required system accounts.

#### **Method 1: Automated Script Approach (Recommended for Initial Setup)**

This method is ideal for initial deployments, migrating an existing instance, or automated CI/CD workflows.

##### **5.1 Prepare Script Environment** You must source the environment configuration before running schema scripts to set necessary variables like database URLs and credentials: i.e. modify the set\_env.sh script for the correct database environment

Bash

cd components/gov-chat-backend/scripts/new-schema-scripts

chmod \+x set-env.sh source set-env.sh

5.2 Create Database Schema

Use the arango-schema-creator.js script to generate the collections, indexes, and graphs.

Bash

\# Ensure you are still in the new-schema-scripts directory and environment is set  
npm install arangojs node arango-schema-creator.js ./arango-schema.json

##### 5.3 Create Initial User Accounts

You must create the default Admin and Manager accounts. These are required for the application to load correctly and for full integration with the Document Repository.

Bash

\# Create the Admin account  
node create-genie-ai-admin-account.js

\# Create the Manager account  
node create-genie-ai-manager-account.js

**Note:** These scripts create accounts with default credentials. It is highly recommended to change these passwords immediately after first login via the Admin Dashboard.

##### 5.4 Populate Hierarchy

Use the create-knowledge-hierarchy.js script to import your Category/Service structure.

* *Note:* Ensure schema validation is temporarily disabled on serviceCategories, services, and categoryServices collections if using an older schema version.

Bash

\# Return to the parent scripts directory if the hierarchy file is there, or adjust the path.  
cd ..  
node create-knowledge-hierarchy.js \--file ./my-hierarchy.json

##### 5.5 Generate Translations

(Optional) Use create-translations.js to auto-generate labels for other supported languages (requires Google Cloud credentials).

#### **Method 2: Manual Admin Dashboard Approach**

This method is ideal for users who prefer a visual interface, or for making incremental changes after an initial setup. This can be done after you have completed **Step 6** and logged into the application.

### **Step 6: Final Verification and Launch**

After all configuration steps are complete, you must restart the services to ensure they pick up the new configurations and verify the system is healthy.

1. Restart Services: \`\`\`bash  
   docker-compose down  
   docker-compose up \-d

2\. Verify Service Health:  
Check that all containers are running and healthy.

Bash

docker ps

*Look for (healthy) status next to critical services like kong, kong-database, vllm, and arango-vector-db.* 3\. Check Logs for Errors:

Inspect the logs again to ensure no new critical errors have appeared after the restart.

Bash

docker-compose logs \-f

4. Initial Login:  
   Access the application in your browser (e.g., [https://localhost](https://localhost) or your configured domain). Log in using the default Admin credentials created in Step 5.3:  
   * **Username:** Admin  
   * **Password:** ADMINadmin

---

### **Step 7: Post-Launch Configuration (Manual Dashboard)**

Once you have logged in as Admin, you can use the visual dashboard to manage your knowledge base.

#### **7.1 Manage the Knowledge Hierarchy**

Navigate to the **Knowledge Hierarchy** tab in the Admin Dashboard.

* **Add Categories:** Click "+ Add New Category" for top-level entries.  
* **Add Services:** Hover over a category and click the plus icon for nested services.  
* **Edit/Delete:** Use hover icons to modify entries.  
* **Translations:** Use the form to add display translations for different languages.

#### **7.2 Upload and Ingest Documents**

Navigate to the **Document Management** tab.

1. **Upload:** Click "+ Upload Files" or "+ Add from Link". Status will be "Pending".  
2. **Apply Labels:** Click the document, and use the "Labels" multi-select dropdown to apply relevant categories/services from your hierarchy.  
3. **Ingest:** Click "Ingest" to trigger chunking, embedding, and storage. Status will update to "Ingested".
