WORKTREE: ${setup.worktreePath}
SPEC_PATH: ${setup.specPath}
PRD_KEY: ${setup.prdKey}

STEPS:
1. Read the spec at SPEC_PATH. If it does not exist, STOP and return posted=false — the
   caller stays silent rather than reporting a post that never happened.
2. Extract the REVIEW section: the heading '## Review Triage Log' (written by
   bmad-build-auto) or '### Review Findings' (written by bmad-code-review), whichever is
   present, running until the next line starting with '## '. Strip HTML comments
   (<!-- ... -->) BEFORE deciding whether anything is left: the spec template ships an
   explanatory comment under the heading, so an unrun review would otherwise look
   non-empty. Empty after stripping → no review content.
3. Extract the IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY from the spec's '## Auto Run Result' section if it has
   one (patches applied, items deferred, score) — two or three lines, no invention. Absent
   section → no summary.
4. If BOTH are empty, STOP and return posted=false. Do NOT post a placeholder.
5. Write the comment body to /tmp/bmad-story-comment-${setup.storyKey}.md, markdown:
     ## Implementation summary
     <summary, or omit this section when empty>
     ## Review findings
     <findings, or omit this section when empty>
6. Resolve the issue: run the Skill once to find it —
     BMAD_ISSUE_ACTION=find \\
     BMAD_ISSUE_KEY="${setup.storyKey}" \\
     BMAD_ISSUE_PRD_KEY="${setup.prdKey}" \\
         Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync
   Capture { issue_id }. If it is empty, STOP and return posted=false (soft-fail).
7. Post it by executing the module's own atomics — do NOT invoke the platform CLI
   directly, the atomic does that:
   a. Read ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/bmad-workflow-lang.md for the workflow
      language specification.
   b. Execute ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/workflows/common/check-config.yaml
      IN FULL — it populates host, project and project_enc.
   c. Execute ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/workflows/common/post-issue-comment.yaml
      IN FULL, with issue_id and comment_file=/tmp/bmad-story-comment-${setup.storyKey}.md
      in scope.
   If the module's files are not present under WORKTREE, skip the post, log why, and return
   posted=false — do not fall back to a raw platform call.
8. rm -f /tmp/bmad-story-comment-${setup.storyKey}.md
9. Return JSON { posted: <bool>, reason: "<short why when false>" }.

// Only the Build phase uses this helper (it invokes Skill: bmad-build-auto).
// Other phases keep using agent() — they don't dispatch subagents.

// Transport: prompt → base64 → bash `echo | base64 -d > /tmp/...` → `cat | claude -p -`.
// Avoids shell quoting hell (apostrophes, backticks, $vars in prompts).

    `PROHIBITIONS:

- DO NOT write polling loops using ps/pgrep/sleep. Use the EXACT PID given in the bash output.
- DO NOT re-invoke claude -p manually.
- DO NOT modify the COMMAND.

TASK:

Run the COMMAND below. It launches claude -p detached and polls its specific
PID for up to 9 minutes. If 9 min elapses, it returns POLLING_REQUIRED — you
then fall back to Read-polling the stdout file.

STEPS:

1. Call Bash with:
   - command: the COMMAND below (full text)
   - timeout: 600000  (10 min max — bash polls for 9 min internally)
   - description: launch + wait claude -p
   Do not pass any other parameters.

2. Parse the Bash output:
   - If it ends with EXIT_CODE=<n>: stdout = everything BEFORE that line,
     exitCode = integer after EXIT_CODE=
   - If it starts with "POLLING_REQUIRED STDOUT=<path>": extract the path.
     Poll that file via Read tool every ~60s (use Bash "sleep 60" between
     Reads). Loop until the file ends with EXIT_CODE=<n>. Max ~10 Reads.
     When found, parse as above.
   - If empty or unrecognized: DO NOT fast-fail. claude -p may still be
     running detached (the nohup'd bash + claude -p survive Bash tool
     timeouts; --verbose wrote progress to stderr). Read-poll the stdout
     file via the Read tool until EXIT_CODE appears:
     - The file path is /tmp/bmad-bc-BMADBC_<storyKey>_<N>.stdout (the
       marker is in the COMMAND below — extract it from the command string).
     - claude -p with --verbose emits progress events. Whether they go
       to stdout, stderr, or both is env-dependent — don't assume. Check
       BOTH stdout and stderr mtimes; claude -p is alive if EITHER file
       grew within the last 30 minutes.
     - The stdout file path is /tmp/bmad-bc-BMADBC_<storyKey>_<N>.stdout
       (extract from the COMMAND below — look for "stdoutFile=" or the
       redirect target). The stderr file is the same basename with
       ".stderr" extension. Use Bash "stat -c '%Y' $stdoutFile" and
       "stat -c '%Y' $stderrFile" to get both mtimes. Compare each to
       current time: Bash "date +%s". If BOTH mtimes haven't changed in
       30 minutes (= 1800 sec), claude -p is likely hung → fast-fail
       with { stdout: "", exitCode: 1 }. DO NOT kill any process — just
       report hung and return.
     - Each loop iteration, run this single Bash check (concise, token-efficient):
         Bash command="STDOUT='<stdoutFile>'; STDERR='<stderrFile>';
         NOW=\$(date +%s); ST_M=\$(stat -c '%Y' \"\$STDOUT\" 2>/dev/null || echo 0);
         ER_M=\$(stat -c '%Y' \"\$STDERR\" 2>/dev/null || echo 0);
         STALE=\$(( NOW - (ST_M > ER_M ? ST_M : ER_M) ));
         echo \"stale_sec=\$STALE\";
         if grep -q '^EXIT_CODE=' \"\$STDOUT\" 2>/dev/null; then echo 'EXIT_CODE_FOUND'; fi"
         timeout=15000
         description="poll claude -p stdout/stderr activity"
       If \`stale_sec > 1800\` (both files silent 30+ min): fast-fail (no kill).
       If \`EXIT_CODE_FOUND\` in output: Read the FULL stdout file via Read tool,
       parse the last NDJSON \`result\` event, extract structured_output,
       return { stdout: JSON.stringify(envelope), exitCode: 0 }.
       Else: sleep 60, repeat. (NO tail during poll — only Read file once EXIT_CODE found.)

     - DO NOT kill processes. Fast-fail returns empty stdout only.

3. CRITICAL: Return ONLY EXTRACTED FIELDS, not the full stdout file.
   The StructuredOutput input limit is ~12KB. The stdout file can be
   100KB+. If you return the raw stdout, you'll be truncated and the
   orchestrator will fail to parse. Return:
     { stdout: <parsed envelope as JSON STRING, not raw stdout>,
       exitCode: <integer> }
   Parse the stdout file, find the last 'result' event (or single envelope
   object), extract its structured_output + is_error + terminal_reason +
   num_turns fields. JSON.stringify those fields as the stdout value.
   The orchestrator's parser extracts structured_output from your stdout.

COMMAND:
${cmd}`,
    { label, phase, schema: {

  `You are the setup agent for story ${storyKey}.

GENERIC DISCOVERY (works for any BMAD PRD — admin-logs-victorialogs, keycloak-idp, mobile-oidc, etc.):

STEPS:
1. Discover repo + PRD worktree:
   a. \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\` → repoRoot (bare git dir, e.g. /home/<user>/git_projects/<org>/genie-ai).
   b. \`git worktree list --porcelain\` → parse PORCELAIN format. Each entry:
      - Line 'worktree <path>' starts a new worktree section.
      - Line 'branch refs/heads/<name>' gives the checked-out branch.
      Find the worktree whose branch matches pattern 'refs/heads/feat/*/prd' (the PRD umbrella branch per _bmad/custom/issue-tracking.yaml branch_patterns.prd). That worktree is prdWorktreePath. The branch suffix after 'refs/heads/feat/' and before '/prd' is the prdKey.
   c. If no worktree matches → HALT (return error in storyKey, prdWorktreePath empty). This workflow requires a PRD umbrella branch + worktree.
2. Read config:
   a. From prdWorktreePath, read _bmad/custom/issue-tracking.yaml. Parse YAML. Required fields:
      - git_platform: gitlab
      - host: <gitlab host>
      - project: <gitlab project path, e.g. un/itu/genie-ai>
      - worktree_base: <relative path from repoRoot, typically .claude/worktrees>
      - branch_patterns.prd: "feat/{prd_key}/prd"
      - branch_patterns.story: "feat/{prd_key}/{story_key}"
   b. Verify prdKey from step 1b matches the project's git remote: \`git -C repoRoot remote -v\`. The remote URL host should match config host.
   c. Construct mrRepo = host + '/' + project (e.g. opensource.unicc.org/un/itu/genie-ai). This is the value the Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync expects in BMAD_MR_REPO. Return it as mrRepo so downstream phases (mr-create) can use it directly.
3. baseBranch = worktree_base-style interpolation: feat/<prd_key>/prd (matches the existing PRD branch you found).
4. Confirm story is ready:
   a. sprintStatusPath = prdWorktreePath + '/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml'.
   b. Read sprintStatusPath. Find development_status[<storyKey>]. Acceptable statuses: 'backlog' (no spec yet — bmad-build-auto will create it in step 02), 'ready-for-dev' (spec committed, ready to implement), 'in-progress' (already in flight — resume case), 'review' (re-attempting after review). REJECT only 'done' (already complete) or 'awaiting-operator' / 'blocked' (deferred by operator). If rejected, HALT with sprintStatusUpdated:false.
5. Sync story branch with prd (use prdWorktreePath for rebase, NOT repoRoot — that would corrupt the main checkout):
   a. \`git -C prdWorktreePath fetch origin <baseBranch> <storyBranch>\`
   b. \`storyCount=$(git -C prdWorktreePath rev-list --count origin/<baseBranch>..origin/<storyBranch>)\`
   c. If storyCount == 0: \`git -C prdWorktreePath push --force-with-lease origin origin/<baseBranch>:refs/heads/<storyBranch>\` (resumedFromBranch=true)
   d. If storyCount > 0 (rebase to preserve unique commits):
      BRANCH=_rebase_story_${storyKey.replace(/\//g, '_')}
      \`git -C prdWorktreePath checkout -b $BRANCH origin/<storyBranch>\`
      \`git -C prdWorktreePath rebase origin/<baseBranch>\`
      \`git -C prdWorktreePath push --force-with-lease origin $BRANCH:<storyBranch>\` || \`git -C prdWorktreePath branch -D $BRANCH\`
      \`git -C prdWorktreePath branch -D $BRANCH\`
      resumedFromBranch=true
   e. If no remote story branch: \`git -C prdWorktreePath push origin origin/<baseBranch>:refs/heads/<storyBranch>\` (resumedFromBranch=false)
   f. baselineSha: \`git -C prdWorktreePath rev-parse origin/<storyBranch>\`
6. Create worktree:
   worktreePath = repoRoot + '/' + worktree_base + '/' + storyBranch-with-slashes-replaced-by-dashes.
   Example: <repoRoot>/<worktree_base>/<storyBranch-slashes-to-dashes>
   Command: \`git -C repoRoot worktree add <worktreePath> <storyBranch>\`.
7. Sync sprint-status INSIDE the story worktree (it's a tracked file; commit goes onto storyBranch):
   cd <worktreePath>
   - Read development_status[<storyKey>] BEFORE updating — store as currentStatus. This is the dispatch-gate value: JS-side shouldAcceptStoryStatus() will halt the run if the status is not backlog / ready-for-dev / in-progress / review. If currentStatus is already 'done', 'awaiting-operator', 'blocked', or any unknown value, do NOT proceed with the sync — return the currentStatus as-is and abort with an error in storyKey (the JS guard will catch it).
   - Update development_status[<storyKey>] = in-progress
   - Find epic-{N} where N = first numeric segment of <storyKey>. Set to in-progress if currently backlog.
   - Update last_updated to "${timestamp}"
   - git add + commit -m "chore(sprint-status): story <storyKey> → in-progress"
   - DO push this commit (so MR create phase has something to point at): \`git push origin \${storyBranch}\` (use --force-with-lease if local is ahead).
7b. Declare that THIS caller owns the whole post-completion chain, so bmad-build-auto's
    terminal hook does NOTHING:
      printf 'ci handled by bmad-build-converge\n' > <worktreePath>/.bmad-ci-handled
    Why: that hook runs the issue-tracking module's chain (post-build-dispatch-auto →
    post-build-dispatch → post-dev-complete), which pushes, ensures the MR, waits for CI,
    writes ci-status.json, updates the issue and posts comments. This orchestrator already
    does all of the machinery itself — it pushes (step 7 and the post-build agent), ensures
    the MR (phase 2), polls the pipeline (the module's wait-for-green-ci atomic) and merges
    (phase C) — so
    running the chain too is a pure duplicate. Worse, its CI wait re-introduces inside every
    build dispatch the delay the convergence loop deliberately removed ("NO CI WAIT …
    saves ~3-5min per iter"); the run traces measured it at 47-305 s per dispatch.
    The module's dispatcher reads this marker at its very first step and stops there, before
    check-config, before the spec read, before any phase. Without the marker the behaviour is
    exactly as before, so bmad-loop and every other consumer are untouched.
    The marker is UNTRACKED on purpose: do NOT git add it, do NOT commit it. It dies with
    the worktree (cleanup removes the worktree at the end of this run).
8. SYNC STORY ISSUE → in-progress on the issue tracker (soft-fail — a missing or
   unreadable issue must NOT block setup). One Skill invocation:
       BMAD_ISSUE_ACTION=set-status \\
       BMAD_ISSUE_KEY="${storyKey}" \\
       BMAD_ISSUE_PRD_KEY="<prdKey discovered in step 2>" \\
       BMAD_ISSUE_NEW_STATUS="in-progress" \\
       BMAD_ISSUE_CLOSE=false \\
           Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync
   Capture { issue_id } from stdout. If non-null → issueStatusSynced=true. If the
   Skill reports the issue not found, errors, or is unavailable → log a WARNING
   and set issueStatusSynced=false. Do NOT halt setup on this step.
   NOTE: this is the ONLY place a story issue moves to in-progress. The converge
   merge agent later moves it to done + closes it. Without this step the story
   issue stays status:backlog for the entire build (the gap this step closes).
9. (NO spec edit here.) bmad-build-auto owns the spec lifecycle — it creates the spec
   from spec-template.md and manages status transitions. The setup agent only owns
   worktree + branch + sprint-status. The file is NOT touched at this stage.
   Resolve specPath — the spec's name is bmad-build-auto's to choose, so DISCOVER it,
   never invent it. Paths below are relative to <worktreePath>.
   Try these in order, first hit wins:
${renderSpecDiscovery(storyKey)}
   - Take the FIRST candidate that matches. If ONE pattern matches SEVERAL files, the
     real spec is the SHORTEST name: escalation artifacts are suffixed
     (spec-<id>-<slug>-blocked-attempt.md is what an intent-gap exit leaves behind), so
     the plain spec is never the longest. Log every candidate you skipped.
   - Only if two matches are the SAME length is this genuinely ambiguous: HALT and list
     them. Never halt merely because a sibling artifact exists.
   - If nothing matches yet (normal first run — the spec does not exist until Build),
     return the FIRST candidate's concrete form for story ${storyKey} — i.e.
     spec-${storyKey}.md under implementation-artifacts (the exact name matches the
     sprint key whenever the key was derived from the same title, which is the normal
     case). Do NOT fall
     back to a stories/<key>.md path — that directory does not exist in sprint mode,
     which is what this PRD uses (sprint-status.yaml is present, no stories.yaml).
   - The slug is derived from the story title and WILL differ from the story key
     (e.g. \`test_hello.py\` → \`test_hello-py\`). Never reconstruct it: at this stage the
     name is only used for prose, and every later phase re-discovers the real file.
   specPath is returned in SETUP_SCHEMA.
10. Stamp the running revision. SCRIPT_PATH is \`${ownScriptPath}\`.
    - If SCRIPT_PATH is non-empty: run \`sha256sum <SCRIPT_PATH> | cut -d' ' -f1\` and
      return the 64-char hash as convergeScriptSha.
    - If SCRIPT_PATH is empty (standalone invocation): return convergeScriptSha "".
    This is provenance only: without it a mid-run redeploy makes two stories of the
    same run behave differently with nothing in the logs to explain the divergence.
    Do NOT fail setup if the hash cannot be computed — return "" and continue.
11. Return JSON with EXACTLY these fields (the orchestrator reads them by name —
    do NOT go read the script to discover them, this list IS the contract):
${describeSchema(SETUP_SCHEMA)}
    The other phases depend on these — incomplete context = broken workflow.

CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT modify prdWorktreePath (the PRD worktree). Only create the story worktree.
- DO push the sprint-status + spec commits to remote (MR create needs them).
- DO NOT skip the sprint-status sync.

OPERATE FROM: ${setup.worktreePath}

STEPS:
1. Prepare the MR description file (must be a separate file — Skill requires BMAD_MR_DESCRIPTION_FILE; cleanup will delete it):
   - IF ${relSpecPath} exists (post-build MR creation OR a pre-existing spec): copy it
     \`cp "${relSpecPath}" /tmp/bmad-mr-desc-${setup.storyKey}.md\`
   - IF ${relSpecPath} does NOT exist (normal case: spec created by bmad-build-auto during Build, not yet at MR-create time): write a placeholder
     Write /tmp/bmad-mr-desc-${setup.storyKey}.md with content from formatMRDescriptionPlaceholder(setup.storyKey) (pure helper, tested in test/pure.test.mjs).
   mrDescFile = /tmp/bmad-mr-desc-${setup.storyKey}.md
2. Invoke MR create via the Skill (wraps atomic find-or-create; soft-fail: if Skill errors, capture error and return without mrIid):
   BMAD_MR_ACTION=ensure-mr \\
   BMAD_MR_SOURCE_BRANCH="${setup.storyBranch}" \\
   BMAD_MR_TARGET_BRANCH="${setup.baseBranch}" \\
   BMAD_MR_TITLE="Story ${setup.storyKey} — bmad-build-converge" \\
   BMAD_MR_DESCRIPTION_FILE="${'${mrDescFile}'}" \\
   BMAD_MR_REPO="${setup.mrRepo}" \
       Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync
   Note: ensure-mr does NOT return mr_iid (per common/ensure-mr.yaml header — "Output variables: (none — call common/find-mr after to resolve mr_iid if needed)"). Capture { mr_url } only.
3. Resolve mr_iid via find-mr (mandatory because ensure-mr doesn't return it):
   BMAD_MR_ACTION=find-mr \\
   BMAD_MR_SOURCE_BRANCH="${setup.storyBranch}" \\
   BMAD_MR_REPO="${setup.mrRepo}" \
       Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync
   Capture { mr_iid } from the Skill's stdout return. If mr_iid is empty (find-mr found nothing — should not happen post-ensure-mr), set mrIid=0 and mrResult.error="find-mr returned no mr_iid after ensure-mr".
4. After the ensure-mr Skill returns: rm -f "${'${mrDescFile}'}" as BMAD_MR_DESCRIPTION_FILE cleanup (per SKILL.md "Cleanup: the Skill caller's agent does rm -f on BMAD_MR_DESCRIPTION_FILE after Skill returns"; best-effort — swallow errors). The temp file lives in /tmp — safe to delete.
5. Fetch first pipeline id (RACE-AWARE: push may not have triggered a pipeline yet; pipeline_id may be empty):
   BMAD_MR_ACTION=get-mr-pipeline BMAD_MR_IID=<captured mr_iid> BMAD_MR_REPO="${setup.mrRepo}" Skill: bmad-issue-tracking-sync.
   Capture { pipeline_id, pipeline_status }. If pipeline_id is empty, treat as "no pipeline yet" — set pipelineId=0 and pipelineStatus="none" (the CI loop will pick up the real pipeline when it polls).
6. If any Skill call soft-fails (no mr_iid returned, OR ensure-mr error), return early with the error string set (NEVER halt the build — Phase 2 fallback is to skip MR creation).

   to ${setup.specPath}; if that does not exist either, return an error naming the
   patterns you tried — do NOT proceed as if the deliverable check had passed.

platform CLI and do NOT poll anything yourself.

STEPS:
1. Read ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/bmad-workflow-lang.md for the workflow
   language specification.
2. Execute ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/workflows/common/check-config.yaml

3. Execute ${setup.worktreePath}/_bmad/_config/custom/workflows/common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml
   IN FULL, with current_branch="${setup.storyBranch}" in scope. It resolves the MR from that
   branch (check-mr-ci → find-mr, i.e. the MR pipeline created in Phase 2), polls every 30s up
   to 30 min, and on failure INCLUDEs get-failed-jobs for diagnostics.
4. Read its outputs: ci_status ("passed" | "no_ci" | "no_mr" | "running" | "failed" |
   "timeout"), pipeline_id, and jobs (failed-job diagnostics — on gitlab a newline-separated
   TSV, each line "name<TAB>exit_code<TAB>trace_tail" with a snake_case exit_code field, NOT
   camelCase; on github raw text).
5. Map it onto the return schema:
   - ci_status "passed" or "no_ci" → status "success". no_ci means the repo runs no CI;
     treating that as a failure would block the story forever. pipelineId from pipeline_id.
   - anything else → status "failed". Build failedJobs=[{name, exitCode, excerpt}] from its jobs output
     (best-effort — an unparseable line becomes one job whose excerpt is the raw line, rather
     than being dropped) and traceTail = the concatenated excerpts.

CONTEXT:
- repoRoot: ${setup.repoRoot}
- prdWorktreePath: ${setup.prdWorktreePath}
- worktreePath: ${setup.worktreePath}
- storyBranch: ${setup.storyBranch}
- mergeResult.merged: ${mergeResult?.merged === true}  ← CRITICAL: only delete worktree/branch if true

WORKING FROM: ${setup.repoRoot} (the bare git root — worktree commands work from here).

STEPS:
0. IF mergeResult.merged === true (MR successfully merged into prd branch):
   1a. Remove story worktree:
       \`git worktree remove --force ${setup.worktreePath}\`
       If already removed (MR --remove-source-branch cleaned it), skip silently.
   1b. Delete local branch if it still exists:
       \`git branch -D ${setup.storyBranch}\` (errors if missing — ignore).
   1c. Prune remote refs:
       \`git remote prune origin\`
   ELSE (merge failed, skipped, or story deferred):
   - DO NOT delete the worktree or branch — keep them for retry.
   - Report keptWorktrees=[worktreePath], keptBranches=[storyBranch] in the return.
1. ALWAYS (regardless of merge status):
   Remove orchestrator log files in ${setup.prdWorktreePath}/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/ matching pattern bmad-build-auto-result-*${setup.storyKey}* (only those for the just-completed story). These are always safe to remove because they're regenerated on retry.
2. Return JSON with EXACTLY these fields:
${describeSchema(CLEANUP_SCHEMA)}

DO NOT remove files outside _bmad-output/.
DO NOT touch sprint-status.yaml or the spec file (those are tracked artifacts).
