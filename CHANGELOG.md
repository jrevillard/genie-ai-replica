## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Contextual Retrieval enabled by default:** Each ingested chunk now gets an LLM-generated document-context prefix that improves embedding quality (the document subject propagates through the vector). Adds one vLLM call per chunk at ingest time. Set `CONTEXTUAL_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED=false` to restore the previous behavior.

### Changed

- **OPEA upgrade from v1.3 to v1.5:** All four OPEA overlay images (chatqna, dataprep, retriever, reranker) now build from OPEA v1.5. The upgrade absorbs 7.5 months of upstream bug fixes and dependency CVEs while preserving GENIE's RAG behavior (retrieval, reranking, labeling, contextual retrieval). Rollback: redeploy the previous v1.3-based image tags.
- **Python 3.11:** Replaces Python 3.10 in all OPEA overlay images (matching OPEA v1.5's base). The dataprep image switched from CUDA/Ubuntu to `python:3.11-slim` (dataprep has no GPU assignment).
- **Hash-pinned dependency locks:** All OPEA services (dataprep, retriever, reranker) now install from `requirements-cpu.txt` files compiled with `uv pip compile --generate-hashes`, verified by `--require-hashes` at build time. Builds are deterministic and supply-chain-pinned (every wheel's SHA256 is verified).
- **Mobile client ID placeholders:** `KC_MOBILE_CLIENT_ID` and `KC_MOBILE_REDIRECT_SCHEME` in the `env` template changed from ITU-specific values to generic institutional placeholders (`genie-mobile-<institution>`, `com.<institution>.genieai`). Existing deployments unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Query endpoint ownership validation:** Query-related endpoints now enforce userId ownership. A user can no longer access query data belonging to another user — the endpoint returns 404 for non-existent queries, 403 for queries owned by another user. (#DW-103)
- **Backend input validation:** API endpoints now validate `limit` and `offset` query parameters with proper bounds checking (min/max constraints). Invalid values (negative, non-numeric) return the default instead of silently producing unexpected queries. (#DW-75, #DW-99, #DW-114, #DW-115)
- **Analytics filters error handling:** The `filters` query parameter on the analytics endpoint now returns a proper 400 error with `INVALID_FILTERS_JSON` code when malformed JSON is provided, instead of crashing with an unhandled exception.
- **Reranker index bounds:** Reranker now handles out-of-range TEI indices defensively — a buggy TEI response that returns fewer scores than documents no longer crashes with `IndexError`; the affected entry is skipped and the partial result is preserved.
- **Docling device auto-detection:** When `DOCLING_DEVICE=cuda` is requested but no GPU is available (CPU-only deployment), the dataprep service now falls back to CPU with a visible warning instead of crashing at docling initialization.

### Security

- **Horizontal privilege escalation prevented:** Query message endpoints now validate that the requesting user owns the queried resource. (#DW-103)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-03

### Security

- **CVE remediation:** 3,466 critical/high vulnerabilities resolved across Docker base images, npm dependencies, and image tags
- **PostgreSQL 13 → 16 upgrade:** PostgreSQL 13 is end-of-life. The default image is now `postgres:16`.
  - **⚠ Deployers MUST follow `docs/UPGRADE.md`** — this is a **mandatory migration** with planned downtime. Run `pg_dumpall`, reset the `genieai`/`kong`/`keycloak` role passwords, and verify before restarting services.

### Changed

- **Docker base images updated:** Node.js `node:22`, Alpine `3.22`, Keycloak `26.7`, PostgreSQL `16`
- **Image tags pinned:** all `:latest` tags pinned to specific versions (Kong `3.9.3`, ClamAV `stable-debian`, vLLM `v0.10.0`, OPEA services, etc.)
- **Reranker default strategy:** `RERANKING_STRATEGY` now defaults to `slice` (top-N) with `RERANKER_TOP_N=3` — the `adaptive` strategy could return 0 documents with low TEI scores

### Fixed

- **Chat responses interrupted:** `max_tokens=None` rejected by pydantic ≥2.13 caused chat stream failures — fixed in ChatQnA

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Quick Help:** configurable dual-prompt system with customizable welcome message, knowledge hierarchy categories, and service labels for precise RAG retrieval filtering
- **Non-English document ingestion:** upload and translate Spanish PDFs into the RAG knowledge base
- **Account management:** administrators can deactivate and reactivate user accounts
- **RAG abstention:** the assistant now says "I don't know" instead of hallucinating when no relevant information is found — toggle via `CHATQNA_ENFORCE_ABSTENTION`
- **Contextual Retrieval (Anthropic-style):** LLM-generated document context is prepended to each chunk before embedding, improving retrieval relevance for domain-specific documents — toggle via `CONTEXTUAL_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED`
- **Reranking strategies:** configurable via `RERANKING_STRATEGY` (slice, threshold, knee, adaptive) — each deployment can select the method best suited to its data
- **Streaming translation:** chat output now streams in the target language during generation instead of waiting for the full English response first — enable via `STREAMING_TRANSLATION_ENABLED`
- **Multi-turn vector-space blending:** previous conversation turns influence retrieval, improving relevance in multi-turn chats — enable via `MULTI_TURN_BLEND_ENABLED`
- **Multi-crop query support:** users can query across multiple crop categories simultaneously
- **Faster document ingestion:** batched LLM labeling (4 chunks per call) with increased concurrency — processing time reduced by an order of magnitude
- **Remote GPU node:** deploy model services (vLLM, TEI) on a dedicated machine with TLS and API key authentication
- **Config-driven locale whitelist:** restrict active UI locales per deployment via `VUE_APP_AVAILABLE_LOCALES` — applies to web, mobile, and Keycloak login pages
- **Documentation site:** public Hugo/Docsy site with redesigned landing page, dark mode, and curated reference docs
- **Model selection guide:** comprehensive documentation on choosing and configuring LLM, embedding, and reranker models
- **Docker Swarm deployment:** fully automated via Ansible — one command to deploy the entire stack
- **Kong API gateway:** production-grade API gateway with automatic route configuration
- **SSL certificates:** automatic Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning and renewal
- **GPU support:** configurable NVIDIA GPU utilization and data type for vLLM inference in Swarm mode
- **Configurable RAG pipeline:** new variables (`ARANGO_PORT`, `EMBEDDING_SERVER_ENDPOINT`, `RETRIEVER_ARANGO_GRAPH_NAME`)
- **Keycloak OIDC authentication:** replaced the legacy authentication system with Keycloak as the central identity provider — single sign-on, password reset, and token lifecycle management
- **Mobile app OIDC migration:** Flutter app now uses Keycloak OIDC with build flavors, custom URL schemes, TLS enforcement, and network error recovery — no more legacy auth
- **SSE streaming:** LLM responses now stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events instead of waiting for the full response
- **Query Inspector:** admin tool for inspecting and debugging RAG pipeline results (what was retrieved, reranked, and sent to the LLM)
- **Dynamic favicon:** the browser favicon is set from the deployment configuration
- **Weather API hardening:** 5-second timeout on all external weather service calls to prevent hangs
- **Observability stack:** OpenTelemetry tracing across the entire RAG pipeline, with Grafana dashboards, VictoriaMetrics, and alerting (enable via `ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY=1`)

### Changed

- **UI theme system:** replaced hardcoded colors with CSS custom properties — custom themes can now be applied by overriding variables
- **Document repository file upload limit:** default reduced from 500 MB to 50 MB — adjustable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE`
- **Translation pipeline:** automatically detects model type from `VLLM_TRANSLATION_MODEL_ID` — no manual config needed
- **Translation backend:** default mode changed from `cpu` to `auto` — the system picks the best available translation method
- **Guardrails:** content guardrail service is now disabled by default; enable explicitly if needed
- **Deployment:** consolidated to a single `docker-compose.yaml` supporting both local dev (`docker compose`) and production Swarm (`docker stack deploy`)
- **Deployment:** all persistent data centralized under `./data/` directory
- **Deployment:** configuration files consolidated into single `configs/` directory
- **Nginx security headers:** `Permissions-Policy` now configurable per environment
- **LLM token limit:** removed the arbitrary 1024 max_tokens default — the LLM can now generate full responses
- **Locale parity:** all 14 locales brought to strict key parity — 81 unused keys removed, 9 missing translations added
