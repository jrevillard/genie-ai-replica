-   **`WeatherPanel.vue`**: A widget displayed at the bottom of the sidebar that shows current weather and a forecast based on user location.

### User Profile & Settings

-   **`UserProfileContainer.vue`**: A container that fetches and manages the data for the user profile, handling loading and error states.
-   **`UserProfileComponent.vue`**: A comprehensive, multi-tab modal for users to view and edit their extensive personal data, including identity, address, health, and employment information.
-   **`PersonalIdentificationTab.vue`**: A specific tab from the `UserProfileComponent`, handling personal details like name, date of birth, and document uploads.

### Analytics & Dashboards

-   **`AdminDashboard.vue`**: A comprehensive administration panel for system monitoring. It includes system health status, resource usage, database management, log viewing, and security scanning tools.
-   **`AnalyticsDashboard.vue`**: A dashboard focused on key performance indicators and user engagement metrics, such as total queries, unique users, response times, and user satisfaction.
-   **`UnifiedAnalytics.vue`**: A detailed, modal-based analytics dashboard that combines usage trends, top queries, service usage distribution, and user satisfaction analysis into a single view.
-   **`AnalyticsComponent.vue`**: A simpler, likely older version of the analytics modal.
-   **`UsageTrendChart.vue`**: A reusable chart component that visualizes usage trends (queries, unique users) over different time periods.

### Reusable Utility Components

-   **`ModalDialog.vue`** & **`ModalComponent.vue`**: Two reusable modal/dialog components for displaying information or forms in an overlay.
-   **`ConfirmDialog.vue`**: A specialized dialog for asking the user for confirmation before performing an action.

-   **`UserEditDialog.vue`**: A dialog used within the Admin Dashboard for administrators to view and manage individual user details, status, and roles.

## Component Interactions

The components interact with each other through the following mechanisms:

1.  **Parent-Child Communication**:
    -   Props flow down from parent to child components (e.g., `SideBarComponent` passing `isOpen` status).
    -   Events flow up from child to parent components (e.g., `ChatResponseFeedbackDialog` emitting a `submit` event to `ChatBotComponent`).

2.  **Event Bus**:
    -   Components communicate across the hierarchy using a shared `eventBus` for cross-component communication.
    -   Key events include `treeNodeSelected` (from `ServiceTreePanelComponent` to `ChatBotComponent`), `contextItemRemoved`, `load-conversation` (from `ChatFolders` to `ChatBotComponent`), and `chat-deleted`.

3.  **Vuex Store**:
    -   Components access and manage shared application state via a Vuex store.
    -   This is primarily used for managing chat history, saved folders, and user information, allowing components like `ChatBotComponent` and `ChatFolders` to interact with the same data source.

## Features

-   Supports English, French, Swahili, and can be extended to other languages by adding new translation files.

## Technical Details

### Component Structure

-   Each component follows Vue.js best practices with a clear separation of template, script, and style sections.
-   Scoped styles are used to ensure component-specific styling does not leak and affect other parts of the application.
-   Props include validation and default values to ensure robust and predictable component behavior.

### State Management

-   A combination of local component state for UI logic and a centralized Vuex store for shared application state (e.g., chat history, user session) is used.
-   User preferences like theme and language are persisted to localStorage.

### Event Handling

-   A combination of standard props/events and a global `eventBus` allows for both tightly-coupled parent-child communication and loosely-coupled communication between distant components.

### Responsive Design

-   Layouts are designed to be mobile-friendly, with features like a collapsible sidebar and responsive grid systems for dashboards.
-   Specific fixes are implemented to handle the on-screen keyboard on Android devices, ensuring a smooth user experience during text input.
