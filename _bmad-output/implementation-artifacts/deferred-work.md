# Deferred Work

Items deferred during code reviews. Revisit when the related component is next modified.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-refactor-backend-indexjs-to-export-createapp (2026-05-13)

- swaggerSpec/swaggerUi silent failure at module-level — if `swaggerJsdoc()` throws, the spec stays undefined and `/api-docs` silently unavailable. Pre-existing behavior, not introduced by the refactor.
- registerRoutes() without external try-catch — the function has internal per-route try-catch blocks but the call site itself is unwrapped. Pre-existing pattern.
- Route loading error handling inconsistency — failed routes are logged and skipped silently. Pre-existing design choice.
- Routes without service (auth-routes) not mounted when `services={}` — calling `createApp({ services: {} })` skips all route registration including routes that don't need services. This matches the AC spec ("routes mounted when services object is provided").

## Deferred from: code review of 2-3-test-backend-auth-route-handlers (2026-05-15)

- Unexpected error path in controller not tested — The controller's try/catch covers session errors but if `res.json()` or `JSON.stringify()` in the audit log throws, the behavior is untested. Pre-existing controller design.
- Sessions returned without _key property — If `getUserSessions` returns sessions missing `_key`, `endSession(undefined)` would be called. Depends on session-service contract guarantee. Pre-existing service contract assumption.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-1-configure-pytest-and-create-shared-fixtures-for-opea (2026-05-15)

- Missing comps submodule mocks for telemetry/retrievers/rerankers paths — `comps.cores.telemetry`, `comps.retrievers.src.*`, `comps.rerankings.src.*` not in sys.modules pre-population. Current list matches spec Dev Notes exactly; will be needed when stories 4.2-4.6 import actual service modules.
- Mock response shapes may need dict-access support — chatqna uses `data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]` (dict access) while mocks provide attribute access only. Stories 4.2-4.6 may need to extend mock helpers for both access patterns.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-4-test-backend-chat-route-handlers (2026-05-15)

- db.collection mock pollution potential — `mockReturnValue` persists after `clearAllMocks`. No actual failure because tests that use `db.collection` re-define it.
- Edge cases pagination (negative values, non-numeric) — `parseInt() || default` handles these correctly. Defensive tests not critical.
- Test failure addMessage after createConversation — The route has no rollback. Error propagation edge case not in ACs.
- AC2: missing userId not tested on all routes — Good defensive practice but not required by AC2 which targets GET /conversations.
- AC6: default pagination values not tested — Correct behavior via `parseInt() || default`.
- **SECURITY**: `GET /query/:queryId/messages` has no userId validation — any authenticated user can access messages for any queryId. Pre-existing security gap, not introduced by this story. Route should validate ownership via `extractUserId(req)`.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-2-test-retriever-hybrid-search-logic (2026-05-16)

- Graph validation unreachable branch in source code — `has_vertex_collection` OR `has_edge_collection` check at line ~583-598 may allow a case where the collection is misconfigured and `db.collection()` raises an unhandled exception. Pre-existing source code issue, not introduced by the tests.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-3-test-dataprep-extraction-pipeline (2026-05-17)

- Race condition in ArangoGraph initialization during concurrent batch processing — production code concern in `genieai_dataprep_arangodb.py`
- File lock `fileno()` edge case when lock_file lacks file descriptor — production code concern
- Concurrent batch failure scenarios — complex concurrency testing out of scope for this story
- Orphan deletion with circular entity references — production edge case
- CancelledError propagation through concurrent batches — complex concurrency test
- Synonym matching plural/singular — not in AC scope, only case-insensitive required
- BM25 tokenization regex `r"\b\w+\b"` — inline regex mocked out in tests, would need extraction to test in isolation
